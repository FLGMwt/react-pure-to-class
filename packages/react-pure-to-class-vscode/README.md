Replaces pure react components with class components.

Select a block of code, choose `React Pure To Class` from the Command Palette.

**IMPORTANT:** This extension requires `jscodeshift` to be available globally, because it's too big to be packed within the extension itself:

```
npm i -g jscodeshift
```
